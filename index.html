<!-- The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation
option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

* Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value
and immediately begins countdown.

* Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering
incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

* When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter
their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.

* Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

* Refer to the animated GIF below for a demonstration of the application functionality. -->




<!-- My Plan HTML

# Create:
- Start block
- Question & answers block
- Answer is correct or wrong message
- Counter block
- Score block

# Create another HTML page for the highest scores

// Plan Java
- Get the element by id from HTML
- Create the objects inside an array for the questions, answers, and the correct answer

# JS
- Create start button and page
- Create a count function
- Create a function to show the questions and answers. A function to render the Q&A: Pull the object properties of 
the array (Quesitons and Answers) in a automatic way.
- Create a function to check if the answer is correct and add a score to the user + go to the next question. -->
